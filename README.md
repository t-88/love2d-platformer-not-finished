# Platformer Game Using Love2d Engine

this a game i am creating, i am not very serious about it just a learning and testing kinda project

## Implemented logic
- basic oga oga camera 
- tile selector 
- lvl editor and saving lvls
- basic player movement (jump , move , wall sliding , wall jumping , coyote jump)
- collision editor (not every tile is collidable) [trying to figure out how to create an auto rect detection](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/129648/algorithm-for-healing-multiple-rectangles-into-a-smaller-number-of-rectangles) 




## Plans
- i will comeback to this game someday somelife !), i just didn`t want to stop dev and leave it in my folders waiting and waiting..., i mean its XP
